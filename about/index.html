<h2 id="whats-certbot">What’s Certbot?</h2>
<p>Certbot is a free, open source software tool for automatically using <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a> certificates on manually-administrated websites to enable HTTPS.</p>

<p>Certbot is made by the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)</a>, a 501(c)3 nonprofit based in San Francisco, CA, that defends digital privacy, free speech, and innovation.</p>

Some Certbot documentation assumes or recommends that you have a working web site that can already be accessed using HTTP on port 80. That means, for example, that if you use a web browser to go to your domain using http://, your web server answers and some kind of content comes up (even if it’s just a default welcome page rather than the final version of your site). Some methods of using Certbot have this as a prerequisite, so you’ll have a smoother experience if you already have a site set up with HTTP.
